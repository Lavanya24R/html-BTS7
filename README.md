# html-BTS7

Welcome to My First Website!
Hi there, and thanks for stopping by!
This was my very first project when I started learning web development. It’s built entirely with basic HTML—no fancy frameworks or styling yet—just the raw essentials.
I’ve come a long way since then, but I keep this project around as a reminder of where it all began. Enjoy exploring!
